=-=- lwt.2.7.0 installed successfully -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
=> The future Lwt 3.0.0 will make minor breaking changes near 1 April 2017. See
     https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/issues/308

=-=- qtest.2.5 installed successfully -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
=> Version similar to 2.4, except it uses qcheck as an external library
     instead of embedding it. There should be no other difference.

     To use it, still call `qtest` on your .ml/.mli files to extract tests,
     then compile the resulting suite using oUnit and qcheck.
