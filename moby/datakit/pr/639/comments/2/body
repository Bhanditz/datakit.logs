It looks like a macOS / Xcode version clash:
```
carthage: A full installation of Xcode.app 9.4 is required to compile this software.
Installing just the Command Line Tools is not sufficient.
Xcode 9.4 cannot be installed on macOS 10.12.
You must upgrade your version of macOS.
```
...
oh

is this still using the EOL circle.yml v1? I think this needs updating to v2. I can take a look.
