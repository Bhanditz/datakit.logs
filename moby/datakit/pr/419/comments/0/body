This is (yet) untested.

It tries to follow a simple design:
- to watch the organisation `foo`, add a file `foo/.monitor`
- if you monitor an organisation,  you will receive all the events for all the repositories of that organisation.
- you can add an org hook if you have either `webhook:w` or `org[foo]:w` capabilities
